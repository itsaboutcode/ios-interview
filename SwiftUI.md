# SwiftUI

## Views and Modifiers

- In SwiftUI, UI is build using **Views** and they are changed using **Modifiers**
- Views in SwiftUI are **structs** that conform to the **View protocol**.
- There is just one property to **implement**, the **body property**.


```js
struct BasicSyntax: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World!") // Adds a text view to the screen
    }
}
```
